/* ===== A DEADLINE ON THE NETWORK (15 Aug 2026) =====
   This worker was network-first with no timeout, and so were the other four. The comment above
   is right that the cache exists so the app opens in a basement - but the old handler only
   reached for the cache when fetch REJECTED, and on one bar of signal a fetch does not reject,
   it hangs. So the cache was never consulted at the one moment it was built for, and the app
   showed a white screen for as long as the radio kept trying.
   Ask the network; if it has not answered in 2.5 seconds serve what is cached and let the
   network finish quietly into the cache. A new version then arrives on the open after the slow
   one instead of never, which is the right trade for an app that opens at all. */
