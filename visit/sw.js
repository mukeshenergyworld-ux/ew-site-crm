   Shell cache for the visit app.

   Only the frame is cached - the HTML, the manifest, the icons. No
   business data ever lands here, because data comes from the Apps
   Script server on another origin and that request is left alone.

   Network first, cache second. That order matters: it means the day
   you upload a new version, every phone gets it on the next open.
   The cache only speaks when the network does not, so a man standing
   in a basement still sees the app instead of the browser's error.

   fetch REJECTED, and on one bar of signal a fetch does not reject, it hangs. So the cache was

   Ask the network; if it has not answered in 2.5 seconds serve what is cached and let the

/* ===== SERVE FROM THE SHELF FIRST (17 Aug 2026) =====
   HIS REPORT: "app response is very slow on android and ios".

   Measured, not guessed. Every one of these workers was NETWORK-FIRST with a 2.5-second
   deadline. Every open of every app therefore waited for the network before it would look at
   the copy it already had - and on a phone in a godown it waited the whole 2,500 ms and then
   served the cache anyway. The CRM's app.js is 1.6 MB; that request was never going to win a
   race on one bar of signal, so the race only ever cost him the 2.5 seconds.

   WHY IT WAS BUILT THAT WAY, AND WHY THAT REASON HAS EXPIRED. The comment above is right that
   a cache-first shell once broke the promise that a change reaches the team on their next open
   - CSS changes never arrived. But on 17 August every app got liveVersion(), a refresh arrow
   and an "a newer version is ready" banner. There is now a LOUD path for a new build, so the
   shell no longer has to be slow in order to guarantee one.

   So: serve what is on the shelf immediately, fetch in the background, and the new build is in
   the cache for the very next open - where the banner announces it. Nothing is lost. The
   2.5-second wait is.

   WHAT STILL GOES STRAIGHT TO THE NETWORK, deliberately:
     - anything carrying a query string. liveVersion() asks for index.html?v=<now> precisely to
       find out what the SERVER has; answered from the cache it would compare the file against
       itself and the update banner would never fire again.
     - the app's own "come back fresh" reload (?u=...), which is the escape hatch a man is told
       to use when something looks wrong.
     - the backend, which is not ours to cache. Stale business data is worse than slow business
       data - that rule stands.
